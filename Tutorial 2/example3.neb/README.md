# PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISE:
## How to perform a transition-state search of a simple elementary chemical reactions using the nudget-elastic-band (NEB) method.
------------------------------------------------------

The corresponding program to perform a transition-state search with
the NEB method is `neb.x`.


**Description of examples:**

* `ex1.H2+H/` -- a simple H transfer reaction, i.e., H + H2 --> H2 + H

* `ex2.H2-diss@Al100/` -- dissociation of H2 molecule on Al(100) surface
